Key: The system converts raw thoughts into visual vidoe representations of future crimes.

body:The brain signals of 'precogs' were transmitted to the AI ​​system as raw data, then the AI ​​processed these raw data as coherent images or video sequences, visualized it and stored this information

2.Real-Life AI: Converting Brain Signals to words/phrases or actions
In the real world, researchers have made great progress in converting thoughts into words/phrases or actions, but how does it work?
Firsty we need Brain Computer Interface. They ranges from non-invasive (EEG)
and invasive(ECoG).

But how they are differ?

EEG(PHOTO) electroencephalogram

non-invasive method ( it requires placing electrodes on the scalp, without need for surgery )

An EEG records the electrical activity of the brain via electrodes attached to the scalp

ECoG(Photo) Electrocorticography

invasive method ( it requires surgery to place electrodes directly on the surface of the brain )

The apparatus detects and records brain waves through electrodes in direct contact with the brain.

What is better?
both methods generally good. Each has weaknesses and strengths
While ECoG costs a lot and requires surgery, signals quality and noise refuction way better than in EEG.

EEG cheaper and safer because it involves only placing electrodes on the scalp, but signals more prone to interface because it measures brain activity from the scalp
