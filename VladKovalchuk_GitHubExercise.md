A fascinating milestone in the history of AI is the creation of ELIZA.
ELIZA is a computer program developed by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966.
Eliza parodies a dialogue with a Psychotherapist, implementing the active listener technique.

ELIZA worked by using a simple pattern-matching technique to respond to users' input messages, often reflecting their statements back at them in a way that prolonged further conversation. For example, if a user said - "I feel sad," ELIZA might reply, "Why do you feel sad?"

Weizenbaum said that Eliza represents a "parody", such as a psychotherapist might be present when first interviewing a patient.
